Help needed with:
* the unknown opcodes (they don't prevent gameplay but still necessary to understand them)
* the args of StartupGraphicsEffect (how are fades configured? is it a double camera system with fading between them?)
* part of the memory layout (the game controller, the missing fields in layers, etc.)
* the save file (is it really simply a memory dump?)
